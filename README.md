Users can add, edit and delete purchases. All these purchases are color coded and the sum of all purchases for a certain category is shown on top. If the table showing all the categories is clicked, a graph appears.

The purchase rows are sortable by clicking any of the columns names.

Recurring monthly expenses can be added, edited, or deleted.

Monthly take home is also editable.

User Stats are updated accordingly showing how much has been spent and how much is left before going over budget.
